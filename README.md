3D Game Development with LWJGL 3
=======

This online book will introduce the main concepts required to write a 3D game using the LWJGL 3 library.

[LWJGL](http://www.lwjgl.org/) is a Java library that provides access to native APIs used in the development of graphics (OpenGL), audio (OpenAL) and parallel computing (OpenCL) applications.This library leverages the high performance of native OpenGL applications while using the Java language.

My initial goal was to learn the techniques involved in writing a 3D game using OpenGL. All the information required was there in the internet but it was not organized and sometimes it was very hard to find and even incomplete or misleading.

I started to collect some materials, develop some examples and decided to organize that information in the form of a book.

**Source code**: The source code of this book will be published in [GitHub](https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook).

**Disclaimer**: English is not my mother tongue. Also I have used the process of writing to learn myself the concepts explained. Please feel free to send any comments and make the corrections you consider in order to improve the book.
