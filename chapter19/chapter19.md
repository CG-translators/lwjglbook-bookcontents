# Animations

By now we have just loaded static 3D models, in this chapter we will learn how to animate them. When thinking about animations the first approach is to create different meshes for each model positions, load them up into the GPU and draw them sequentially to create the illusion of animation. Although this approach is perfect for some games it's not very efficient (in terms of memory consumption).

This where skeletal animation comes to play. In skeletal animation the way a model animates is defined by its underlying skeleton. A skeleton is defined by a hierarchy of special points called joints. Those points are defined by their position and rotation. Since it's a hierarchy the final position for each joint is affected by their parents. For instance, think on a wrist, the position of a wrist is modified if a character moves the elbow and also if it moves the shoulder.

Joints do not need to represent a physical bone or articulation, they are artifacts that allows the creatives to model an animation. Besides joints we still have vertices, the points that define the triangles that compose a 3D model. But, in skeletal animation, vertices are drawn based on the position of the joints it is related to.
